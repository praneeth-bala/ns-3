/**
 * \ingroup scheduler
 * \brief a calendar queue event scheduler
 *
 * This event scheduler is a direct implementation of the algorithm
 * known as a calendar queue, first published in 1988 in
 * "Calendar Queues: A Fast O(1) Priority Queue Implementation for
 * the Simulation Event Set Problem" by Randy Brown. There are many
 * refinements published later but this class implements
 * the original algorithm (to the best of my knowledge).
 *
 * The default behavior is to store events in each bucket in
 * increasing timestamp order.  This can be changed to reverse
 * timstamp order using the Attribute \c Reverse,
 *
 * To change the ordering use the following pattern:
 * \code
 *   ObjectFactory factory ("ns3::CalendarScheduler");
 *   factory.SetAttribute ("Reverse", BooleanValue (true));
 *   Simulator::SetScheduler (factory);
 * \endcode
 *
 * \note This queue is much slower than I expected (much slower than the
 * std::map queue) and this seems to be because the original resizing policy
 * is horribly bad.  This is most likely the reason why there have been
 * so many variations published which all slightly tweak the resizing
 * heuristics to obtain a better distribution of events across buckets.
 *
 * \note While inserion sort is not discussed in the original article, its
 * implementation appears to dramatically affect performance.
 * The default implementation sorts buckets in increasing (chronological)
 * order.  The alternative, sorting buckets in decreasing order,
 * was adopted in NS-2 because they observed that new events were
 * more likely to be later than already scheduled events.
 * In this case sorting buckets in reverse chronological order
 * reduces enqueue time.
